# Custom Asset Extraction Tool (CAET) for Megamix
This is a tool designed to take custom assets created within the Megamix engine and copy them into a new set of folders seperated from the default assets. Files are kept in the same specifications of directories, making it easy to port them into a new project file.

Currently, asset collection is based on nomenclature specified for MaGMML3 (e.g. sprGannio_MySprite), so objects must have a specific username/word after the intial prefix in order to be collected.
